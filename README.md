# ShapeCNF

ShapeCNF is a simple, fast, and accurate change-point detection method which uses shape-based features to model the patterns and a conditional neural field to model the temporal correlations among the time regions.

This work is supervised by Prof Ooi Wei Tsang in National University of Singapore.
